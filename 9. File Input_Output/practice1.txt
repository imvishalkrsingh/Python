     file = open('filename.txt', 'r')
     ```

2. **Question:** How can you read the contents of a file in Python?
   - **Answer:** You can read the contents of a file using methods like `read()`, `readline()`, or `readlines()`. For example:
     ```python
     content = file.read()
     ```

3. **Question:** What is the difference between `read()` and `readlines()` methods when reading from a file?
   - **Answer:** The `read()` method reads the entire content of the file as a single string, while the `readlines()` method reads the content line by line and returns a list of lines.

4. **Question:** How do you close a file in Python after reading from it?
   - **Answer:** You can close a file using the `close()` method. For example:
     ```python
     file.close()
     ```

5. **Question:** How do you open a file in Python for writing?
   - **Answer:** You can open a file for writing using the `open()` function with the mode `'w'`. For example:
     ```python
     file = open('filename.txt', 'w')
     ```

6. **Question:** How can you write to a file in Python?
   - **Answer:** You can write to a file using methods like `write()` or `writelines()`. For example:
     ```python
     file.write("Hello, world!\n")
     ```

7. **Question:** What happens if you try to open a non-existent file in Python for reading?
   - **Answer:** If you try to open a non-existent file for reading, Python will raise a `FileNotFoundError` exception.

8. **Question:** How do you handle file closing automatically in Python?
   - **Answer:** You can use the `with` statement to automatically close the file after performing operations on it. For example:
     ```python
     with open('filename.txt', 'r') as file:
         content = file.read()
     ```
